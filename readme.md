# Week One Project
- HTML
- CSS


Note:

Problem I have:

# Home page
1. Home page imagine: I have trouble to make them wrap inside the container,
and use flex-grow to make img1 to be wider than other.

2. Logo is not inline with nav.

#about me page
1. Troube make the second img float next to the <p> and margin right to fit with
other <p>

2. Room to grow imagine is fuzzy, and not cover line of sreen.
